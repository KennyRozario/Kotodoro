Kotodoro is a minimal productivity timer inspired by the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

There are no ads, just opportunities for users to increase their productivity. 

Currently, the timeres are set to the following:
- Tasks last 25 minutes
- Short breaks last 5 minutes
- Long breaks last 20 minutes

There are some plans for future releases:
- [ ] Adjustable durations
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] Theme-ing 
- [ ] Reset timer that's in progress
